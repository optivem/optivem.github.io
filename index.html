					<p></p><h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>Our mission is to deliver technological solutions which drive business success, to make our clients happier and more profitable. We work at the intersection of business and technology. We are motivated to understand clients’ true business needs and to realize their vision through software solutions.</p>
<h3>Our values</h3>
<p>Our values define us and our client relationships. We believe in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on client objectives and business value</li>
<li>Open, transparent and regular communication</li>
<li>Flexibility and adaptability – we embrace change</li>
<li>Innovation, learning and continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our experience</h3>
<p>We have experience in custom software development, financial software and business analytics. Our custom software development spans several industries: finance and banking, sales and consumer analytics, mathematical computing, medical technologies, transport and logistics. We have cross-cultural experience working with customers in Europe, United States and Australia.</p>
<h3>Our principles</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;core principles which underlie our approach to software development:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt&nbsp;80-20 philosophy&nbsp;by focusing on business value</li>
<li>Focus on integration of technology into business operations</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, business success and profitability is the goal that we are striving for. Our goal is <em>not</em> to make software that has 101 bells-and-whistles. Our goal <em>is</em> to deliver real business value and help&nbsp;our clients become even more successful.</p>
<h3>Our approach</h3>
<p>Our approach is to use the 80-20 principle to deliver highest value to clients.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our development approach is based on lean practices and iterative development methodology.</li>
<li>Our consultative approach is client-centric and focused on business value.</li>
<li>Our approach to training is project-based and&nbsp;interactive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our fees</h3>
<p>Clients deserve to know how much services will cost. Clients don’t want end-of-project surprises whereby they discover that they’ll have to make further investments and end up paying double or triple more than they originally envisiged. We adopt the fixed fee value-based arrangements for a given project scope so that payments are known ahead of time. We seek to work effectively within&nbsp;client&nbsp;budgets to deliver maximal value.</p>

					<p></p><h3>Software design &amp; development</h3>
<p>Our services span the whole software development process, from concept to testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business requirements analysis</li>
<li>Software architecture design</li>
<li>Software quality assurance</li>
<li>Technical training &amp; coaching</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Business requirements analysis:</strong> Identifying core&nbsp;business requirements is&nbsp;critical to project success. We adopt an 80-20 approach to help work with you to identify the requirements and core functionalities that matter the most to your business. We use rapid prototyping to help ensure that your business requirements are understood. We work with you to formulate your key objectives and document use cases and workflows, as well as creating prototypes of graphical user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Software architecture design:</strong> Our goal is to design scalable and flexible software architectures. We develop and design quality software architecture which supports modularity, configurability, and extensibility. We also recognize that software requirements change over time and that is why we seek&nbsp;to avoid over-engineering but instead capture fundamental elements in architecture and create a robust foundation which allows modifications as user requirements change.</p>
<p><strong>Software quality assurance:</strong> We strive to ensure that our software fulfills <em>external</em> and&nbsp;<em>internal</em> quality criteria. Testing external software quality helps ensure that the software meets business requirements and provides business value. Testing internal software quality helps ensure that software is easy to maintain, enables adaptations to changing business requirements, and is efficient and robust.</p>
<p><strong>Technical training &amp; coaching:</strong> Our technical training services are designed to help software developers (both junior and senior) enhance skills in software design, software development and best practices. We offer short courses in C#.NET and Java as well as specialized courses in design patterns and mathematical computing. Our training is delivered remotely via skype and/or email. We also offer customized coaching to help clients in their day-to-day projects.</p>
