It answers the question: Where is this company going in the future? What does this company hope to achieve? What does this company hope to become in the future? What impact does the company want to make in the future?

By identifying these ultimate goals, it provides a long term organizational roadmap. Thus, the vision is key to the strategic plan. It provides foresight and direction to the employees, inspiring them to reach the company goals. It provides direction to the company leaders and managers to develop the business in the long-term. 

The vision statement is aspirational and forward-thinking, it's going beyond what others have achieved and it's extending the limits of what is possible. The vision is the big company dream, the significant impact it will have on the world. The vision has an element of innovation, risk and excitement, it's a powerful force that drives the company to the next level.
