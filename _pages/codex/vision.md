<h2>Introduction</h2>

Vision, mission and values are the core elements of successful IT organizations. These reflect the core of who the company, its core ideals and aspirations, and what it hopes to achieve, a sense of meaning and purpose, condensed through powerful statements, which serve as both internal and external communication tools - shared with employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders, providing them with a concrete way to understand the company. They have a critical impact on long term success - affecting the leadership appraoch, providing direction to sales and marketing, increasing employee engagement and productivity and ultimately leading to finanical benefits and increased profitability. 

<h2>Vision</h2>

The company vision communicates the future-based long-term goals and aspirations of the organization. It's like taking out the telescope and looking at the farthest stars. It answers the question: Where is this company going in the future? What does this company hope to achieve? What does this company hope to become in the future? What impact does the company want to make in the future?

By identifying these ultimate goals, it provides a long term organizational roadmap. Thus, the vision is key to the strategic plan. It provides foresight and direction to the employees, insiring them to reach the company goals. It provides direction to the company leaders and managers to develop the business in the long-term. It leads to highly engaged and mobilized employees, who serve as highly motivated company ambassadors and who put in 110% into the company. This leads to increased productivity and profitability.

The vision statement is aspirational and forward-thinking, it's going beyond what others have achieved and it's extending the limits of what is possible. The vision is the big company dream, the significant impact it will have on the world. The vision has an element of innovation, risk and excitement, it's a powerful force that drives the company to the next level.

<h2>Mission</h2>

Unlike the future-based dreams reflected through the company vision, the mission is present-based and practical. It's about the "now" - What is the company doing now? What is the company's reason for existence, what is its purpose?

The mission statement communicates the current organizational operations and operational goals:

<ul>
	<li>Whom does the company serve? Who are the primary customers, the target market and geographical region in which the company operates?</li>
	<li>What and how does the company serve? What are the services and products that the company provides? What's the company's line of business?</li>
	<li>Why the company serves? Why does the company do what it does? Why does the company exist? What purpose does it serve? What is differentiation factor - what is unique about the company and its products and services, why does it appeal to the target customer?</li>
</ul>

The mission statement is a powerful statement about what the company does every day, about the current state and purpose.
