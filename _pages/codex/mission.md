<h2>What is the organizational mission</h2>

Unlike the future-based dreams reflected through the company <a href="{{ site.url }}/codex/vision">vision</a>, the mission is present-based and practical. It's about the "now" - What is the company doing now? What is the company's reason for existence, what is its purpose?

The mission statement communicates the current organizational operations and operational goals:

<ul>
	<li>Whom does the company serve? Who are the primary customers, the target market and geographical region in which the company operates?</li>
	<li>What and how does the company serve? What are the services and products that the company provides? What's the company's line of business?</li>
	<li>Why the company serves? Why does the company do what it does? Why does the company exist? What purpose does it serve? What is differentiation factor - what is unique about the company and its products and services, why does it appeal to the target customer?</li>
</ul>

The mission statement is a powerful statement about what the company does every day, about the current state and purpose.

<h2>How does the organizational mission affect organizational success?</h2>

The mission is critical in communicating to the employees who the company is, and provides a sense of meaning and purpose. Through effectively communicating this information, it helps the company serve its customers in the best way by helping align employees' actions with the current organizational operational goals.
