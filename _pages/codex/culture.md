<h2>What is an organizational culture?</h2>

Organizational culture (or corporate culture, company culture, workplace culture) is driven by organizational values and guides organizational behaviours, thus forming the organizational environment. It is comprised of the following aspects:

<ul>
	<li>Structural aspect: core underlying shared values, belieds, assumptions, attitudes, expectations, norms, systems, experiences, vision, written and unwritten rules</li>
	<li>Behavioural aspect: guides and influences behaviours of organizational members, affecting group interactions both internally (among employees) and externally (with clients and other stakeholders), affects how members communicate and the language used, how things get done within the organization</li>
</ul>


Organizational culture is the large chunk of the iceberg, submerged beneath the water.

<h2>What is the relationship between organizational culture and leadership styles?</h2>

There is a bidirectional relationship: leaders form cultures and cultures form leaders.

<ul>
	<li>Leaders are the architects of organizational culture, they create, maintain and evolve the culture</li>
	<li>Established cultures affect the leadership styles which emerge, cultures influence the leaders</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of organizational cultures</h2>

Based on the Competing Values Framework 4, the following culture types emerged:

<ul>
	<li>Clan Culture: the organization is like a large company held by loyalty, strong bonds, teamwork and consensus. Leaders serve as mentors and facilitators.</li>
	<li>Adhocracy Culture: dynamic organization driven by creativity, innovation and risk-taking whereby the target is to produce new products or services and where experiments and innovation are how people bond. Leaders are innovatiors, entreprenours, visionaries and risk-takers.</li>
	<li>Market Culture: results-oriented organization focused on getting things done, goal-oriented tough and competive environment, whereby the empahsis on winnin is what bondsa everyone together, market pentration and market leadership. Leaders are hard drivers, rivals and producers</li>
	<li>Hierarchy Culture: fornalized and structured organization, driven by procedures, policies and efficiency, with smooth planning and predictable delivery, leaders are coordinators, organizers and monitors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does culture affect organizational success?</h2>
 
There is a strong inseparable link between organizational culture, leadership and employee engagement. When the organizational culture is characterized by a positive environment and when leaders support employees in achieving organizational goals, then this leads to higher employee engagement, satisfaction and motivation. On the other hand, negative organizational cultures can bring down productivity and performance. Thus, organiaztional culture has a critical impact on the organizational performance.
