organizaional culture
* STRUCTURAL: underlying shared values, belies and assumptions, attitudes, expectations, norms, written and unwritten rules, the language, the systems, experiences, vision
* BEHAVIOURAL: which guide behaaviour, ways of interacting (behaviour), influences behaviour of organizaional memmbers, guide what happens by defining situationally-appropriate behaviour, effect group interactions both internally (among employees) and externally (clients and other stakeholders), affects how much employees identify themselves with the org, illustrates how people should behave, how organizations do things
which form the organizational environment

It's the way things are done.

how cultures and developed and communicated:

There is bidirectional relatiosship between the leaders of the organization and the organizational cutlures. On one hand, the leadders are the "architects" of the organizational culture and they maintain and evolve the culture. But on the other hand when the organizational culture is established, it affects the leadership styles which emerge.

behvioural perspective: culture since it communciates how people should behave supports employees in achieving their goals. If it's in sync and employee feels that the leaders are supporting them in achieving organizaional goals then higher satisfaction... thus a close link between organizaional culture, learderhsip and employee satisfaction. Hoever, organizaional cultures if negative can bring down prdoductivity and performance. But if good then motivates.

Organizational culture is the large chunk of the iceberg, submerged beneath the water, invisible but yet affects everything.
