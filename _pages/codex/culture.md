<h2>What is an organizational culture?</h2>

Organizational culture (or corporate culture, company culture, workplace culture) is driven by organizational values and guides organizational behaviours, thus forming the organizational environment. It is comprised of the following aspects:

<ul>
	<li>Structural aspect: core underlying shared values, belieds, assumptions, attitudes, expectations, norms, systems, experiences, vision, written and unwritten rules</li>
	<li>Behavioural aspect: guides and influences behaviours of organizational members, affecting group interactions both internally (among employees) and externally (with clients and other stakeholders), affects how members communicate and the language used, how things get done within the organization</li>
</ul>


Organizational culture is the large chunk of the iceberg, submerged beneath the water.

	<li>Established cultures affect the leadership styles which emerge, cultures influence the leaders</li>
</ul>
